This weeks challenge was to create a daily to list by hours. The title html was supplied to us, but we needed to add todays date in a more readable format then we received from moment.js. The main challenge was to be able to enter a task, save it and have the task persist. 

It was important to include bootstrap.js, jQuery.js and moment.js third party APIs in the code. For the javascript code I dynamically created the button event listeners. Had some trouble with the css this challenge.
